# Chapter 7 of NLP with Transformers

Chapter 7 from *NLP with Transformers* is about Question and Answering, covering both extractive and early generative methods.

## Reading
Read Chapter 7 & [*Knowledge Retrieval Architecture for LLM’s*](https://mattboegner.com/knowledge-retrieval-architecture-for-llms)

## Optional Homework
Finetune a retrieval-augmented model on [TriviaQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trivia_qa) (or a subset)

Possible starting point: [*How to Finetune the Entire RAG Architecture (including DPR retriever)*](https://shamanesiri.medium.com/how-to-finetune-the-entire-rag-architecture-including-dpr-retriever-4b4385322552)
