# Chapter 6 of NLP with Transformers

Chapter 6 from *NLP with Transformers* is about text summarization.

**Homework**

- Fine-tune a model on the SAMSum dataset. See if you can beat the book's Pegasus results.
- Compare and contrast a modern instruct LLM (ChatGPT, Bing AI, Google Bard, OpenAssistant, etc) against neural summarization models using [*Summary Explorer*](https://tldr.webis.de).
